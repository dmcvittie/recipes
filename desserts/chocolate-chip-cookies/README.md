# Chewy choco chip cookies 🍪

## WET

- 180 g (3/4 cup) unsalted butter
- 100 g (1/4 cup) sugar
- 250 g (1 ¼ cup) dark brown sugar (not golden yellow)
- 1 egg
- 1 egg yolk
- 2 tablespoons milk (we use 2% because that’s what we buy)
- 1 1/2 teaspoons (i.e., ½ Tbsp) vanilla extract

## DRY

- 286 g (2 ¼ cups) BREAD flour (bread flour has more gluten, which makes it chewier) (note for double batch, it is 572 g)
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt (or ½ tsp regular salt)
- 1 teaspoon baking soda

## Directions

1. Weigh butter into large microwavable bowl and microwave until just melted.
2. Weigh sugar + brown sugar into melted butter, mix until combined.
3. Add the 1 egg, 1 yolk + milk + vanilla, mix until lighter in color.
4. Weigh the dry ingredients into batter and mix by hand.
5. Pour in as many chocolate chips as you like. Add other nuts/chips if you like.

### To prepare for freezing

6. Use a small (1 Tbsp- I have a Cake Boss one) cookie batter scoop to scoop out cookie dough balls onto cookie sheet lined with saran wrap. Dough balls can be touching. Add some extra choco chips on top of dough balls that look like they need more choco chips.
7. Place saran over dough balls and refrigerate until easy to handle (harder and can pick up).
8. Place appropriate number of dough balls into Ziploc bag/container and freeze.

### Baking

9. If frozen: Place dough balls on parchment-lined cookie sheet and let sit for about 30 mins until more/less at room temperature. Bake at approximately 375°F, 8-10 mins.

### Storage

10. After baking, allow to cool to room temperature. Cookies will be crispy outside, soft inside if eaten fresh. After cooling, place in an airtight container for an hour or so (allow cookies to rest and water content to redistribute) to get chewier cookies that are more/less the same consistency throughout (i.e., not crispy on the outside).
11. Don’t bother keeping for more than 1 day… because the whole point of freezing them was to ensure a steady supply of FRESH cookies 😃

### Notes

- **A)** Number of dishes to wash: 1 large bowl, 1 large spoon, Tbsp measuring spoon (use the same one for vanilla and milk), cookie dough scoop, 1 knife used to cut butter, 1 plate (used to rest the large spoon, cookie dough scoop, knife), a small bowl used to separate the egg (or to avoid this extra dish, I just separate directly over the sink and discard the white b/c I never end up using it!). Usually, I wash the dishes while the cookies are baking 😊.
- **B)** If making a double batch (which I usually do if I freeze the dough balls), use a KitchenAid. I have a stainless steel bowl, so I have to dirty up an extra bowl to microwave the butter and transfer it to the Kitchen Aid bowl 😔. Will also need an extra spatula to scrape down sides of the bowl periodically.
- **C)** Don’t need to waste valuable time sifting together dry ingredients first (just weigh flour first into batter and then dump the baking soda on top of the flour). I sifted in the past and didn’t notice any differences in cookie outcomes.
- **D)** If you’re using an oven that takes forever to preheat, you may want to turn it on when you start the recipe (my oven takes like 15 mins to preheat, so sometimes I’m done before the oven is ready. My countertop Breville oven only takes like 2 mins to preheat, so I usually just use that to make like a dozen cookies 😊).
