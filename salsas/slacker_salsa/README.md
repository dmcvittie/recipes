## Slacker Salsa


## Ingredients
- 6 roma tomatoes
- 1.5-2 quartered white onions (large)
- 5-6 serrano or jalapeño peppers
- Cilantro (roughly same amount as onion)
- 2 tsp kosher salt
- 1 tsp black pepper
- 1 tbsp of soy sauce
- Juice from 1/2 lime (optional)

## Directions
1. Char tomatoes/onions/peppers on the BBQ (High heat)

    1. Tomatoes will go orange then turn black and start to crack, turn it and do the same on the other side
    2. Onions until they’re transparent, just a little charred, turning a couple of times
    3. Serrano/jalapenos until cactus green but not quite black, turning more frequently

2. Slice onions and peppers (0.75cm dice); about 2 to 1 ratio of peppers to onions
3. Put tomatoes in a bowl, crush tomatoes with a beer bottle (or something with grooves in the bottom)
4. Add peppers and onions to tomatoes
5. Chop and add cilantro
6. Mix gently then crush again with beer bottle
7. Add salt + pepper + soy sauce, mix gently

    * Add optional juice of 1/2 lime

8. Let sit for a while to set up; best if left overnight in the fridge but it can also be served hot
