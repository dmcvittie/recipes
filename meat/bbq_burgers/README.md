Here is my recipe for traditional grilled hamburgers:

AP seasoning recipe:

1. 1/4 cup of salt
2. 1/4 cup of ground black pepper
3. 1/4 cup of garlic
   Note: These amounts can vary based on your preference. I tend to use a little less salt because that's what my family prefers.

4. Mix salt, pepper, and garlic in a shaker bottle.
5. Shake thoroughly to combine.

Burger recipe:

1. Medium ground beef -- 0.25 lbs or 4 ounces per patty. Or make bigger patties if you like!
2. 1 shaker Montreal Steak Spice
3. 1 shaker AP seasoning
4. Brioche buns
5. Parchment paper squares
6. (Optional) Cheese

Patty construction:

1. Cover two plates with plastic wrap -- one covered on the normal eating side, one covered on the bottom of the plate. These will be used to press your burgers.
2. Place a parchment square on the bottom plate.
3. Prepare a 4oz (or whatever size you have) handful of ground beef into a loosely packed ball. Do not overwork the ball.
4. Place the 4oz ball of beef onto the parchment paper square.
5. Cover with another parchment square.
6. Put the second plate on top of the beef/parchment and push down until the burger is about 1/4 inch or as flat as you desire.
7. Remove the plate and top piece of parchment.
8. Apply a coating of the AP rub to desired seasoning.
9. Set aside and keep in the fridge (with the bottom parchment still attached) until it's time to grill.

Grilling:

1. Scrape and clean your grill grates so there is no leftover food or gunk from previous grilling.
2. Preheat your grill for 10-20 minutes on medium heat until the grill grates are very hot and will retain a lot of heat. If you have a larger grate, this step is important to get good grill marks.
3. Once the grates are fully hot, turn the heat up to medium-high.
4. Oil the grill with canola, vegetable, or other general-purpose oil on a paper towel.
5. Place the patties AP-seasoned-side-down so there is at least 1 inch of space between each patty.
6. (Optional) Sprinkle Montreal Steak Spice on the top (unseasoned) side.
7. Cook for 70-90 seconds or until you can see deep grill marks on the bottom.
8. Using a BBQ spatula, rotate the burgers 90 degrees. Do not flip them over yet. Cook for another 60-90 seconds.
9. Turn the grill down to medium heat and flip the burgers over. Cook until desired level of doneness using a thermometer or until the juice runs clear. If the burgers flare up, move them as needed.
10. (Optional) Add any cheese for cheeseburgers.
11. Toast your buns and assemble burgers.
