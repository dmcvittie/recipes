# Vietnamese Lemongrass Chicken Vermicelli Recipe

This recipe is for a traditional Vietnamese Bun dish (salad bowl), but the chicken also goes great on a banh mi sandwich!

## Nuoc Cham Sauce

- 1 tablespoon lime juice
- 4 tablespoons sugar
- 5 tablespoons fish sauce
- 3/8 cup water
- 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 2 cloves of garlic

## Chicken (or Pork) Marinade

- 2 tablespoons sesame seeds
- 3/8 cups of sugar
- 3 tablespoons hoisin sauce
- 3 tablespoons Korean BBQ sauce
- 2 tablespoons honey
- 2 tablespoons sesame oil
- 2 tablespoons oyster sauce
- 3 tablespoons fish sauce
- 3 tablespoons light soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons oil
- 1/4 cup chopped shallots
- 5 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/4-1/2 cup chopped lemongrass
- 2 tablespoons cooking wine

## Other Ingredients

- 6-10 boneless, skinless chicken thighs (or breasts, or pork)
- Rice stick vermicelli noodles
- Lettuce, shredded
- Cucumber, sliced into thin matchsticks
- Carrots, sliced into thin matchsticks
- Fresh bean sprouts
- Fresh mint leaves

### Instructions:

1. Combine all the ingredients for the nuoc cham sauce in a container and mix well. Refrigerate.
2. Prepare a ziploc bag or container to make the marinade in.
3. Take the thick stalk of the lemongrass and remove the other 2 layers and slice off the stem end and discard. With the remaining lemongrass, slice it into thin discs then chop it.
4. Add the remaining marinade ingredients to the bag/container and mix well.
5. Add the chicken thighs to the bag/container and leave for at least 4 hours, or as long as overnight, turning/mixing occasionally.
6. Remove the chicken thighs from the marinade and shake off any big chunks of remaining lemongrass. Let it sit on a plate/rack for a few minutes to drain a bit.
7. Preheat a grill over medium or medium-high heat until the grates are ripping hot, ready to sear.
8. Turn the heat up to medium-high or high and place the chicken on the grill. Grill for 2-4 minutes or until the chicken is seared and has grill marks, but not burnt.
9. Turn the chicken and sear the other side.
10. Continue cooking and flipping the chicken until it reaches a temperature of 165Â°F.
11. Boil the vermicelli noodles as per the directions on the bag, usually 1-5 minutes depending on the brand.
12. Drain the noodles and place them into large bowls for serving.
13. Add the lettuce, carrot, cucumber, and sprouts on top of the noodles.
14. Slice the chicken into bite-sized pieces and place a generous amount into the bowl beside the veggies.
15. Drizzle the nuoc cham dressing onto the dish and add a sprig or two of fresh mint.
