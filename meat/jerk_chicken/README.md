# Jerk Chicken Thighs with Walkerswood Hot & Spicy Jerk Seasoning

## Ingredients

- 6 bone-in chicken thighs
- 1/2 cup Walkerswood Hot & Spicy Jerk Seasoning
- 1 habanero pepper, seeded and finely chopped _(use gloves while handling the pepper to avoid irritation)_
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1-inch piece of ginger, minced
- 3-4 green onions, finely chopped

## Instructions

1. In a medium-sized mixing bowl, combine the Walkerswood Jerk Seasoning, habanero pepper, minced garlic, minced ginger, and chopped green onions. Mix the ingredients well to ensure they are evenly distributed throughout the marinade.

2. Apply the marinade generously over the chicken thighs, making sure to coat all sides evenly. You can use a silicone brush or your hands _(wearing gloves)_ to spread the marinade.

3. Place the marinated chicken in a covered container or a large zip-top plastic bag and refrigerate for at least 24 hours to allow the flavors to fully penetrate the meat.

4. Remove the chicken from the fridge and let it sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes before cooking.

5. Preheat your pellet grill/smoker to 225°F (107°C) for indirect cooking.

6. Place the marinated jerk chicken thighs on the smoker, skin side up. Close the lid and let them smoke for approximately 1.5 to 2 hours, or until the internal temperature of the chicken reaches 160°F (71°C).

7. While the chicken is smoking, preheat your gas grill with a sear zone or charcoal grill on high heat.

8. Once the chicken has reached the desired internal temperature, transfer it to your preheated gas grill with a sear zone or charcoal grill. Sear the chicken thighs on the hot sear zone for about 2-3 minutes per side, or until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 175°F (79°C) and has a nice charred exterior.

9. Remove the chicken from the grill and let it rest for a few minutes before serving.
