# Braised Beef Short Ribs with Red Wine Reduction

This recipe is an adaptation of a Gordon Ramsey recipe. This is a great meal to serve to guests but, in my opinion, even better as pulled beef on a sandwich or over fries/poutine.

## Ingredients
- 4-8 meaty beef short ribs with the bones in (the original recipe calls for 6 VERY meaty ones but just get enough to fill the pan) 
- 750mL bottle of red wine (a cheap Cabernet Sauvignon works well)
- Olive oil
- 1 large head of garlic, cut in half as a cross-section
- 1.5 tablespoons/half a can of tomato puree (or paste)
- 1 litre of beef stock (could be more or less depending on the size of your pan)
- Salt and pepper
- 1 tablespoon of corn starch mixed in roughly a quarter cup of water until smooth

## Directions

### Preparing the ribs
1. Trim the ribs of any large pieces of fat.
2. Prepare the garlic, tomato puree, and wine so it is easily accessible.
3. Season the 5 non-bone sides liberally with salt and pepper.
4. In a deep walled roasting pan (ideally something steel or aluminum that you don't mind scraping), heat enough olive oil to nearly cover the bottom of the pan over medium heat.
5. Place the short ribs in the heated pan bone side up to begin searing until browned. Rotate the short ribs so all 5 non-bone sides are browned. **Note:** You may need to move the ribs around the pan to deal with hot spots.
6. When nearly done browning the short ribs, reduce the head to medium-low. Add the garlic head (cut side down) and tomato paste to the pan. Cook for ~30 seconds.
7. Remove the browned short ribs from the pan and add the red wine to deglaze. Use a wooden spachula to scrape the bits from the bottom of the pan.
8. After deglazing, add the short ribs back to the pan bone side down.
9. Bring the liquid to a simmer and wait for it to reduce by half.
10. Once the wine has reduced, add enough beef stock to nearly cover the short ribs. The amount will vary based on the size of your pan.
11. Cover tightly with aluminum foil and place in a preheated 325F oven.
12. Cook for 3-4 hours basting every 45-60 minutes until the meat is fork-tender.

### Red Wine Reduction
1. After the ribs are finished cooking, remove them from the pan and cover with foil.
2. Pour the liquid and remnants in the pan through a fine, metal strainer into a saucepan.
3. Using a spoon, push the garlic through the strainer and scrape it into the liquid.
4. Allow the liquid to cool slightly and skim the fat from the surface of the saucepan.
5. Add the corn starch and water to the liquid and heat the liquid over a medium heat, stiring often.
6. Continue stirring the liquid until it has the desired consistency -- from a thin jus to a thick gravy.

This recipe is designed to have the short ribs served as-is with the bone in, drizzled with the red wine reduction and pairs well with rice, potatoes and/or grilled/roasted veggies.

However, I like to remove the bones from the meat and pull it apart with 2 forks while it is still warm and tender. Then it can be added back to the red wine reduction to serve as classy pulled beef. This is also my preferred format for leftovers,
