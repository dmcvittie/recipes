# Grilled Chicken Breasts for Sandwiches

This recipe is more about method, but these are sthe spice rubs and brine I use.

## Ingredients

- 2-6 boneless skinless chicken breasts, butterflied so they're an even thickness
- Olive oil to coat chicken

### Brine

- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- 1 to 2 cups of dill pickle juice
- 1 teaspoon of black pepper
- Enough water to submerge the chicken

### AP Seasoning

- 1/4 cup of garlic powder (NOT garlic salt!!)
- 1/4 cup of salt
- 1/8 cup of black pepper

### BBQ Rub

- 2 tablespoons garlic powder
- 1 tablespoon ground cumin
- 1 tablespoon ground coriander
- 1 tablespoon paprika
- 1 tablespoon kosher salt
- 1 tablespoon black pepper
- 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper

## Directions

**NOTE: The seasoning and rub is for more seasoning than just for this recipe. Store it and use it on whenever you see fit**

### AP Seasoning

1. Combine garlic powder, salt and black pepper in a shaker container (like an old spice jar) and shake to mix
2. Adjust the salt/garlic ratios to taste as you see fit

### BBQ Rub

1. Combine rub ingredients in a shaker container (like an old spice jar) and shake to mix

### Brine Phase

1. Put 2 tablespoons of brown sugar in a large shallow dish/bown or ziplock bag
2. Grind black pepper on top of the brown sugar
3. Add 1-2 cups of pickle juice (scale this depending on how many chicken breasts you have)
4. Add the same amount of water as you did pickle juice
5. Add chicken breasts to the brine
6. Add more water to ensure the chicken breasts are submerged
7. Brine in the fridge for 2-4 hours

### Post-brine Phase

1. Remove the chicken breast from the brine and rinse each piece under cold water
2. Dry the chicken breast with paper towels to get most of the water off
3. Pour a little bit of olive oil over the chicken -- this is just for the spice to stick to. Mix the chicken around to ensure it's well coated in oil. A little bit of oil goes a long way!
4. Coat each side of chicken with a base layer of AP seasoning and leave it on a plate or in a bowl
5. Coat each side of chicken with a generous dose of the BBQ rub and put it back on the plate/bowl. Use a little less rub if it's being eaten as a stand-alone dish and not as par of a sandwich/salad/etc
6. Keep it in the fridge for 1-1.5 hours when

### Grilling

1. Preheat a grill for 15-20 minutes on medium high heat to get the grates
2. Oil the grates to prevent sticking
3. Place the chicken breast on the grill and let it cook for 2-4 minutes, until you're seeing grill marks and char on one side
4. Flip and cook until you're seeing char on the other side, 2-4 minutes again
5. Continue cooking and flipping the chicken until it hits an internal temperature of 160F in the thickest part of the chicken breast
6. Remove from the grill, let it rest for a few minutes and serve on a bun with toppings or eat by itself.
