# Chicken Souvlaki

## Ingredients
- 2lb of boneless, skinless chicken cut into 1.5”/3cm cubes
- 1/3 cup of extra-virgin olive oil
- 3 tablespoons of lemon juice
- 3 tablespoons of red wine
- 2 teaspoons of coriander seeds (ground)
- 2 teaspoons of dried greek oregano (plus more for post-marinade)
- 1.5 teaspoons of salt
- 0.5 teaspoons of black pepper
- 2 cloves of garlic, minced
- Metak ir wood skewers

## Directions

### Marinade (15 minutes; 12-24 hours in fridge)
1. Mix all marinade ingredients in a ziplock bag. Massage through the bag or mix with a spoon.
2. Add the chicken to the ziplock bag and massage the chicken to distribute the marinade.
3. Marinade in the fridge overnight. Massage the chicken every few hours to ensure an even marinade.

### Prep + Cooking (25 minutes)
0. If using wood skewers, soak for 1 hr in warm water so they won’t burn on the grill.
1. Thread the chicken onto the skewers; about 4-5 inches of chicken per skewer at most.
2. Cook on the grill for 12-15 minutes until no longer pink and juices run clear, turning every couple of minutes to achieve desired level of char.
